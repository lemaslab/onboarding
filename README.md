# 🧬 Welcome to Your ALP Internship at the LemasLab!

We’re thrilled to have you join the **LemasLab**, led by [Dr. Dominick Lemas](https://hobi.med.ufl.edu/profile/lemas-dominick/), where we combine **precision health**, **biomedical informatics**, and **early-life research** to explore how maternal and infant exposures shape health outcomes.

Our lab focuses on:
- **Causal relationships** between early life exposures and perinatal health outcomes.
- **Microbe-host interactions** that influence pediatric obesity.

You'll play an important role in advancing this research while developing essential data science and scientific literacy skills.

## 🚀 What You'll Be Working On

As an ALP intern, you’ll support multiple aspects of our lab’s work, including:

- Refining onboarding/training documentation for future interns.
- Processing and analyzing data.
- Visualizing data.
- Literature review. 

**Your toolkit** will include:
- **R programming** for data wrangling and visualization.
- **Excel** for managing participant data.
- **GitHub** for version control and team collaboration.
- **Adobe Creative Suite** (optional) for infographics or presentation materials.

## 🔬 Ongoing Research Projects

### 1. Breastfeeding and Early Child Health (BEACH) Study  
A longitudinal birth cohort examining how maternal obesity and early-life nutrition impact infant growth and long-term child health.

### 2. Maternal Outcomes Monitoring via Electronic Health Records (MOM-EHR)  
A retrospective study that uses EHR data to assess how maternal health influences neonatal outcomes.

## 📅 Your First Few Weeks

To get started, you’ll:
- Complete onboarding and volunteer forms.
- Read foundational literature to understand the research context.
- Tackle beginner-friendly GitHub “issues” that introduce you to our coding environment and collaborative workflow.

**No experience with R or GitHub? No problem!**  
This is a **learning-focused internship**—we’ll provide all the guidance and resources you need.

---

## 🧠 Skills You'll Develop

- **R Programming**: Work hands-on with real-world health data.
- **GitHub Collaboration**: Learn version control and team-based project management.
- **Scientific Literacy**: Read and apply relevant biomedical literature.
- **Professional Communication**: Interact with researchers and contribute meaningfully to team discussions.

---

## 🌟 Your Impact

The work you do will directly contribute to improving our understanding of maternal-infant health—and help build a better onboarding experience for interns who follow in your footsteps.

We encourage curiosity, questions, and collaboration. Mistakes are part of the learning process, and you’re supported every step of the way.
